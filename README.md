# climate-dashboard

This project is part of the class "Intro to Data Science with Python" made available by Harvard through EdX. It aims at experimenting with climate data (global temperature by country, by city, and natural disasters) and visualise the evolution of temperature raise, as well as disasters. In the forecast parts, I also experiment with basic time-series seasonal model, like SARIMAX. 

The datasets used for the projects are the following, available for download on Kaggle:
